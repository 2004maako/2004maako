	Scenario: Assume you have been assigned to develop an online website for a retailer of clothing. Sections for new arrivals, promotions, and other apparel categories should all be present on the website.
•	Create a simple website using HTML tags, that is divided into sections for each category of clothes (e.g., Men's, Women's, Kids).
•	Add as much information as possible about the products to the pages, such as pictures, descriptions, prices, and availability
